So for this assignment I was given the task to create in unity some basic c# scripts and link it to a cube. The ones I was tasked to complete were to create a button that would link two separate scenes. Shown below, which using the button next, would jump from the first scene, to the next. 

To return to the main screen you would just click the return button. This part of the assignment was actually what I finished first, as I found a couple youtube videos about how to get the button to work. I was happy to get it working the first time, and I am pretty sure this is the basis on how to get a basic start menu to work. All I had to do was add a script that would increment that scene index, up and down.  

The next part I worked on was to change the shading for the program. To get this to work, all I had to do was change the directional light to different colors. To get the light to change you have to press the down arrow key. To reverse it, press the up key. I had some slight difficulty with this one because, following the video, I was unable to link this action directly to a button, so I just linked it to the keypress instead. It worked better, but I am slightly annoyed I couldnâ€™t get the button to work.

This last part was to link an animation to a button. To follow the theme set by my teammates, I used a cube and I only attempted to make it spin in place, using only a button, failing that just to use a keypress. I unfortunately was unable to complete this step. It was weird because I had created the animation, and got the code written, but I was unfortunately unable to get the button or the keypress to work. Everything is there, maybe someone can figure it out.

Overall, I was pretty happy with the way my project turned out, I was slightly disappointed I was unable to complete all three points, but it mostly worked out. The solutions were pretty easy to get, and coding with c# is pretty intuitive. Getting the buttons to do what you want was where I struggled with the most, and I hope in the future I will solve that.
